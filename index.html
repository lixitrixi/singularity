      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Singularity Solutions was created by Nova Crane and Felix Leitner, two students of Classical High School in Providence, RI. Seeing themselves and many of their peers struggling with unnecessarily heavy materials in their bags, often suffering physical consequences as a result, drove the founding partners to look for a solution. The lack of technology available to address the problem prompted them to create a fusion of tech and design that would vastly improve student's lives.</p>

      <h1>Our Product</h1>
      <p>Singularity Solutions offers multiple unique variations and designs of its signature product: the HackPack. Through the use of a pocket-sized wormhole, the backpack can hold an essentially infinite amount of items with no impact to its weight. This makes it the ideal solution for a busy school day, greatly reducing the time needed between classes and taking the strain away from students walking long distances to or from school.</p>
